C    Preconditioner Tools for Reaction-Transport Problems
C    Part II: Block-Grouping in Block-Diagonal Reaction-Based Factor
C                        14 September 1995
C
C The following four subroutines -- SGSET2, GSET1, SRBGJA, SRBGPS --
C are provided to assist in the generation and solution of
C preconditioner matrices for problems arising from reaction-transport
C systems, as solved with DASPK.  More specifically, they are intended
C as tools for preconditioners that include a contribution from the
C reaction terms of the system.  These are intended as auxiliary
C routines for the user-supplied routines JAC and PSOL called by
C DASPK when the Krylov method is selected.
C
C These routines are intended for a DAE system obtained from a system
C of reaction-transport PDEs, in which some of the PDE variables obey
C evolution equations, and the rest obey algebraic (time-independent)
C equations.  See Ref. 2, Section 4.  It is assumed that the 
C right-hand sides of all the equations have the form of a sum of a
C reaction term R and a transport term S, that the transport term
C is discretized by finite differences, and that in the spatial
C discretization the PDE variables at each spatial point are kept
C together.  Thus the DAE system function, in terms of a dependent
C variable vector u, has the form
C     G(t,u,u') = I_d u' - R(t,u) - S(t,u) ,  where
C     I_d = identity matrix with zeros in the positions corresponding
C           to the algebraic components, ones in those for the
C           evolution (differential) components.
C     R(t,u) = the reaction terms (spatial coupling absent), and
C     S(t,u) = the spatial transport terms.
C
C As shown in [2], two possible preconditioners for such a system are:
C (a) P_R = c I_d - dR/du, based on the reaction term R alone, and
C (b) P_SR = (I - (1/c) dS/du) (c I_d - dR/du), the product of two
C     factors (in either order), one being P_R and the other being
C     based on the spatial term S alone.
C Here c is the scalar CJ that is input to the JAC and PSOL routines
C provided by the user (1/c is proportional to the step size H).
C
C The routines given here can be used to provide the reaction-based
C factor P_R.  More precisely, they provide an approximation A_R to 
C P_R.  The matrix P_R is block-diagonal, with each block corresponding
C to one spatial point.  In A_R, we compute each block by difference
C quotient approximations, by way of calls to a user-supplied routine,
C subroutine RBLOCK, that evaluates the reaction terms at a single
C spatial point.  In addition, rather than evaluate a block at every
C spatial point in the mesh, we use a block-grouping scheme, described
C in Ref. 1.  In this scheme, the mesh points are grouped, as in domain
C decomposition, and only one block of dR/du is computed for each group;
C then in solving A_R x = b, the inverse of the representative block is
C applied to all the blocks of unknowns in the group.  Block-grouping
C greatly reduces the storage required for the preconditioner. 
C
C The routines given here are specialized to the case of a 2-D problem
C on a rectangular mesh in the x-y plane, and for a block-grouping
C arrangement that is rectangular (i.e. the Cartesian product of two
C 1-D groupings).  However, they can be easily modified for a different
C problem geometry or a different grouping arrangement.  It is also
C assumed that the PDE variables are ordered so that the differential
C variables appear first, followed by the algebraic variables.
C
C To make use of these routines in a DASPK solution, the user must
C provide:
C (a) a calling program that sets the DASPK input parameters, and calls
C     SGSET2 to set the mesh and block-grouping data needed later;
C (b) a JAC routine, as prescribed by the DASPK instructions, which
C     calls SRBGJA, and does any other Jacobian-related preprocessing
C     needed for preconditioning; and
C (c) a PSOL routine, as prescribed by the DASPK instructions, which
C     calls SRBGPS for the solution of systems A_R x = b, and does
C     any other linear system solving required by the preconditioner.
C Detailed descriptions and instructions are given below.
C
C In addition, the use of these routines requires:
C  * the LINPACK routines SGEFA and SGESL for dense linear sytems, and
C  * the machine constant routine R1MACH for the machine unit roundoff.
C
C (a) The calling program.
C The calling program sets the DASPK inputs and makes calls to DASPK.
C Here the DASPK inputs include
C   INFO(12) = 1 [to signal the Krylov method]
C   INFO(15) = 1 [to signal the presence of a JAC routine]
C Also, the use of the SRBGJA/SRBGPS routines in conjunctin with
C DASPK requires that certain mesh-related and block-grouping data
C be set.  This can be done with the call
C     CALL SGSET2 (MX, MY, NS, NSD, NXG, NYG, LID, IWORK)
C The input arguments to SGSET2 are:
C   MX and MY = the mesh dimensions.
C   NS  = number of PDE variables.
C   NSD = number of differential PDE variables.
C   NXG = number of groups in the x direction.
C   NYG = number of groups in the y direction.
C   LID = offset in IWORK for array showing the differential and
C         algebraic components on input to DASPK, required if either
C         INFO(11) = 1 or INFO(16) = 1.  Set LID = 0 otherwise.
C         If this array is required, set LID = 40 or 40 + NEQ,
C         depending on the value of the constraint option INFO(10).
C
C SGSET2 loads mesh parameters and group data in two COMMON
C blocks, /SRPRE1/ and /RPRE2/, used by these routines.
C Note: the declaration of /RPRE2/ in SGSET2, SRBGJA, and SRBGPS
C uses a parameter MAXM that must be .GE. MAX (MX, MY);
C this must be altered for larger mesh sizes.
C
C SGSET2 also loads the preconditioner work lengths into
C IWORK(27) and IWORK(28), and if LID > 0 it sets the ID array
C in IWORK showing the differential and algebraic components.
C
C SGSET2 generates a rectangular grouping arrangement, with
C partitioning in each mesh direction being uniform (or as nearly
C uniform as possible), by calling the routine GSET1 twice.
C If a different grouping arrangement is desired, the user must
C alter or replace SGSET2 accordingly.
C 
C (b) The JAC routine.
C The user-supplied JAC routine called by DASPK with the Krylov
C method specified, is to generate and preprocess Jacobian-related
C data as needed for later solution of the preconditioner system
C P x = b.  Assuming that P is to be an approximation of either P_R
C or P_SR, the JAC routine should call SRBGJA for the approximation
C A_R to P_R.  Subroutine SRBGJA generates A_R using difference
C quotients and the block-grouping information.  It then performs an
C LU decomposition of each block, using the LINPACK routine SGEFA.
C
C In terms of the arguments passed to JAC by DASPK, the call to
C SRBGJA should have the form
C     CALL SRBGJA (T, U, R0, RBLOCK, WK, REWT, CJ, WP, IWP, IER)
C where we use U instead of Y for the dependent variable array.
C The argument R0 is an array assumed to contain the current value
C of the R vector, at the current values (T,U).  This can be done, for
C example, by taking R0 to be RPAR, and loading RPAR with the
C vector R in the last call to the RES routine; in that case, the
C calling program must declare RPAR to have length at least NEQ.
C Alternatively, insert a call to RBLOCK (see below) within the
C loop over mesh points in SRBGJA.
C
C To use SRBGJA, the user must provide the following subroutine,
C which SRBGJA calls to obtain individual blocks of R:
C      SUBROUTINE RBLOCK (T, JX, JY, UXY, RXY)
C The input arguments to RBLOCK are:
C   T     = current time.
C   JX,JY = spatial indices in x- and y-directions.
C   UXY   = block of NS dependent variables at spatial point (JX,JY).
C RBLOCK is to load block (JX,JY) of R(t,u) into the array RXY.
C
C (c) The PSOL routine.
C The user-supplied PSOL routine must solve the linear system P x = b,
C where P is the preconditioner matrix.  For this, the PSOL routine
C should call SRBGPS for the solution of A_R.  Subroutine SRBGPS
C solves a linear system A_R x = b, using the LINPACK backsolve
C routine SGESL.  In terms of the arguments passed to PSOL by DASPK,
C the call to SRBGPS should have the form
C     CALL SRBGPS (B, WP, IWP)
C SRBGPS overwrites the B array (containing b) with the solution x.

C***DESCRIPTION
C
C-----------------------------------------------------------------------
C This routine sets mesh and block-grouping data needed to use the
C SRBGJA and SRBGPS routines, assuming a 2-D rectangular problem with
C uniform rectangular block-grouping.  Given the mesh and group
C parameters, it loads the COMMON blocks /SRPRE1/ and /RPRE2/, and the
C lengths LENWP and LENIWP in IWORK.  Then if LID > 0, it also sets the
C ID array in IWORK, indicating which components are differential and
C which are algebraic.
C
C The variables in the COMMON blocks are defined as follows:
C   SRUR   = SQRT(unit roundoff), used in difference quotients.
C            UROUND = R1MACH(4) generates the unit roundoff.
C   MP     = NS = number of PDE variables, the size of each block in 
C            the block-diagonal preconditioner matrix P_R.
C   MPD    = NSD = number of differential PDE variables.  In the DAE
C            system, the first MPD variables at each spatial point have
C            time  derivatives, and the remaining (MP - MPD) do not.
C   MPSQ   = MP*MP.
C   MESHX  = MX = x mesh size.
C   MESHY  = MY = y mesh size (the mesh is MESHX by MESHY).
C   NGX    = NXG = no. groups in x direction in block-grouping scheme.
C   NGY    = NYG = no. groups in y direction in block-grouping scheme.
C   NGRP   = total number of groups = NGX*NGY.
C   MXMP   = MESHX*MP.
C   JGX    = length NGX+1 array of group boundaries in x direction.
C            Group igx has x indices jx = JGX(igx),...,JGX(igx+1)-1.
C   JIGX   = length MESHX array of x group indices vs x node index.
C            x node index jx is in x group JIGX(jx).
C   JXR    = length NGX array of x indices representing the x groups.
C            The index for x group igx is jx = JXR(igx).
C   JGY, JIGY, JYR = analogous arrays for grouping in y direction.
C The COMMON block /RPRE2/ declared below has arrays whose minimum
C lengths depend on MX, MY, NXG, and NYG.  For simplicity, the
C declaration uses a single parameter MAXM, assumed to be .GE. all
C four of these numbers.  If this declaration is altered here, it must
C be altered consistently in subroutines SRBGJA and SRBGPS.

C***DESCRIPTION
C
C-----------------------------------------------------------------------
C This routine generates and preprocesses a block-diagonal
C preconditioner matrix, based on the part of the Jacobian corresponding
C to the reaction terms R of the problem, using block-grouping.
C It generates a matrix of the form CJ * I_d - dR/du.
C It calls SGEFA to do LU decomposition of each diagonal block.
C The computation of the diagonal blocks uses the mesh and grouping
C information in the COMMON blocks /SRPRE1/ and /RPRE2/.  One block
C per group is computed.  The Jacobian elements are generated by
C difference quotients.
C This routine calls a user-supplied routine of the form
C      SUBROUTINE RBLOCK (T, JX, JY, UXY, RXY)
C which is to set RXY to block (JX,JY) of R, as a function of the
C current time T and block UXY of current dependent variable vector U.
C The array R0 is assumed to contain the current value of R at (T,U).
C-----------------------------------------------------------------------
C On input:
C   T      = current value of independent variable.
C   U      = current dependent variable array.
C   R0  = array of current values of the vector R at (T,U)
C   RBLOCK = name of external routine that computes a single block of R.
C   R1     = array of length NEQ for work space.
C   REWT   = reciprocal error weights.
C   CJ     = scalar used in forming the system Jacobian.
C
C On output:
C   BD     = array containing the LU factors of the diagonal blocks.
C   IPBD   = integer array of pivots for the LU factorizations.
C   IER    = integer error flag.  If no error occurred, IER = 0.
C            If a zero pivot was found at stage k in one of the LU
C            factorizations, this routine returns IER = k > 0.
