C    Preconditioner Tools for Reaction-Transport Problems
C    Part I: Block-Diagonal Reaction-Based Factor without Grouping
C                        14 September 1995
C
C The following three subroutines -- DMSET2, DRBDJA, DRBDPS --
C are provided to assist in the generation and solution of
C preconditioner matrices for problems arising from reaction-transport
C systems, as solved with DASPK.  More specifically, they are intended
C as tools for preconditioners that include a contribution from the
C reaction terms of the system.  These are intended as auxiliary
C routines for the user-supplied routines JAC and PSOL called by
C DASPK when the Krylov method is selected.
C
C These routines are intended for a DAE system obtained from a system
C of reaction-transport PDEs, in which some of the PDE variables obey
C evolution equations, and the rest obey algebraic (time-independent)
C equations.  See Ref. 2, Section 4.  It is assumed that the 
C right-hand sides of all the equations have the form of a sum of a
C reaction term R and a transport term S, that the transport term
C is discretized by finite differences, and that in the spatial
C discretization the PDE variables at each spatial point are kept
C together.  Thus the DAE system function, in terms of a dependent
C variable vector u, has the form
C     G(t,u,u') = I_d u' - R(t,u) - S(t,u) ,  where
C     I_d = identity matrix with zeros in the positions corresponding
C           to the algebraic components, ones in those for the
C           evolution (differential) components.
C     R(t,u) = the reaction terms (spatial coupling absent), and
C     S(t,u) = the spatial transport terms.
C
C As shown in [2], two possible preconditioners for such a system are:
C (a) P_R = c I_d - dR/du, based on the reaction term R alone, and
C (b) P_SR = (I - (1/c) dS/du) (c I_d - dR/du), the product of two
C     factors (in either order), one being P_R and the other being
C     based on the spatial term S alone.
C Here c is the scalar CJ that is input to the JAC and PSOL routines
C provided by the user (1/c is proportional to the step size H).
C
C The routines given here can be used to provide the reaction-based
C factor P_R.  More precisely, they provide an approximation A_R to 
C P_R.  The matrix P_R is block-diagonal, with each block corresponding
C to one spatial point.  In A_R, we compute each block by difference
C quotient approximations, by way of calls to a user-supplied routine,
C subroutine RBLOCK, that evaluates the reaction terms at a single
C spatial point.  A_R has one such block for each spatial point in
C the mesh.  (For a more economical approximation, see Part II,
C on block-grouping in A_R.)
C
C The routines given here are specialized to the case of a 2-D problem
C on a rectangular mesh in the x-y plane.  However, they can be easily
C modified for a different problem geometry.  It is also assumed
C that the PDE variables are ordered so that the differential
C variables appear first, followed by the algebraic variables.
C
C To make use of these routines in a DASPK solution, the user must
C provide:
C (a) a calling program that sets the DASPK input parameters, and calls
C     DMSET2 to set mesh data and mesh-related DASPK inputs;
C (b) a JAC routine, as prescribed by the DASPK instructions, which
C     calls DRBDJA, and does any other Jacobian-related preprocessing
C     needed for preconditioning; and
C (c) a PSOL routine, as prescribed by the DASPK instructions, which
C     calls DRBDPS for the solution of systems A_R x = b, and does
C     any other linear system solving required by the preconditioner.
C Detailed descriptions and instructions are given below.
C
C In addition, the use of these routines requires:
C  * the LINPACK routines DGEFA and DGESL for dense linear sytems, and
C  * the machine constant routine D1MACH for the machine unit roundoff.
C
C (a) The calling program.
C The calling program sets the DASPK inputs and makes calls to DASPK.
C Here the DASPK inputs include
C   INFO(12) = 1 [to signal the Krylov method]
C   INFO(15) = 1 [to signal the presence of a JAC routine]
C
C Also, the use of the DRBDJA/DRBDPS routines in conjunction with
C DASPK requires that certain mesh-related data be set.  This can be
C done with the call
C     CALL DMSET2 (MX, MY, NS, NSD, LID, IWORK)
C The input arguments to DMSET2 are:
C   MX and MY = the mesh dimensions.
C   NS  = number of PDE variables.
C   NSD = number of differential PDE variables.
C   LID = offset in IWORK for array showing the differential and
C         algebraic components on input to DASPK, required if either
C         INFO(11) = 1 or INFO(16) = 1.  Set LID = 0 otherwise.
C         If this array is required, set LID = 40 or 40 + NEQ,
C         depending on the value of the constraint option INFO(10).
C DMSET2 loads mesh data in a COMMON block /DRPRE1/ used by the
C DRBDJA/DRBDPS routines.
C
C DMSET2 also loads the preconditioner work lengths into
C IWORK(27) and IWORK(28), and if LID > 0 it sets the ID array
C in IWORK showing the differential and algebraic components.
C 
C (b) The JAC routine.
C The user-supplied JAC routine called by DASPK with the Krylov
C method specified, is to generate and preprocess Jacobian-related
C data as needed for later solution of the preconditioner system
C P x = b.  Assuming that P is to be an approximation of either P_R
C or P_SR, the JAC routine should call DRBDJA for the approximation
C A_R to P_R.  Subroutine DRBDJA generates A_R using difference
C quotients.  It then performs an LU decomposition of each block,
C using the LINPACK routine DGEFA.
C
C In terms of the arguments passed to JAC by DASPK, the call to
C DRBDJA should have the form
C     CALL DRBDJA (T, U, R0, RBLOCK, WK, REWT, CJ, WP, IWP, IER)
C where we use U instead of Y for the dependent variable array.
C The argument R0 is an array assumed to contain the current value
C of the R vector, at the current values (T,U).  This can be done, for
C example, by taking R0 to be RPAR, and loading RPAR with the
C vector R in the last call to the RES routine; in that case, the
C calling program must declare RPAR to have length at least NEQ.
C Alternatively, insert a call to RBLOCK (see below) within the
C loop over mesh points in DRBDJA.
C
C To use DRBDJA, the user must provide the following subroutine,
C which DRBDJA calls to obtain individual blocks of R:
C      SUBROUTINE RBLOCK (T, JX, JY, UXY, RXY)
C The input arguments to RBLOCK are:
C   T     = current time.
C   JX,JY = spatial indices in x- and y-directions.
C   UXY   = block of NS dependent variables at spatial point (JX,JY).
C RBLOCK is to load block (JX,JY) of R(t,u) into the array RXY.
C
C (c) The PSOL routine.
C The user-supplied PSOL routine must solve the linear system P x = b,
C where P is the preconditioner matrix.  For this, the PSOL routine
C should call DRBDPS for the solution of A_R.  Subroutine DRBDPS
C solves a linear system A_R x = b, using the LINPACK backsolve
C routine DGESL.  In terms of the arguments passed to PSOL by DASPK,
C the call to DRBDPS should have the form
C     CALL DRBDPS (B, WP, IWP)
C DRBDPS overwrites the B array (containing b) with the solution x.

C            UROUND = D1MACH(4) generates the unit roundoff.
C   MP     = NS = number of PDE variables, the size of each block in 
C            the block-diagonal preconditioner matrix P_R.

C            system, the first MPD variables at each spatial point have

C   MPSQ   = MP*MP.
C   MESHX  = MX = x mesh size.
C   MESHY  = MY = y mesh size (the mesh is MESHX by MESHY).

C***DESCRIPTION
C
C-----------------------------------------------------------------------
C This routine generates and preprocesses a block-diagonal
C preconditioner matrix, based on the part of the Jacobian corresponding
C to the reaction terms R of the problem.
C It generates a matrix of the form CJ * I_d - dR/du.
C It calls DGEFA to do LU decomposition of each diagonal block.
C The computation of the diagonal blocks uses the mesh information in
C the COMMON block /DRPRE1/.  One block per spatial point is computed.
C The Jacobian elements are generated by difference quotients.
C This routine calls a user routine of the form
C      SUBROUTINE RBLOCK (T, JX, JY, UXY, RXY)
C which is to set RXY to block (JX,JY) of R, as a function of the
C current time T and block UXY of current dependent variable vector U.
C The array R0 is assumed to contain the current value of R at (T,U).
C-----------------------------------------------------------------------
C On input:
C   T      = current value of independent variable.
C   U      = current dependent variable array.
C   R0  = array of current values of the vector R at (T,U)
C   RBLOCK = name of external routine that computes a single block of R.
C   R1     = array of length NEQ for work space.
C   REWT   = reciprocal error weights.
C   CJ     = scalar used in forming the system Jacobian.
C
C On output:
C   BD     = array containing the LU factors of the diagonal blocks.
C   IPBD   = integer array of pivots for the LU factorizations.
C   IER    = integer error flag.  If no error occurred, IER = 0.
C            If a zero pivot was found at stage k in one of the LU
C            factorizations, this routine returns IER = k > 0.
C Here BD is the RWORK segment WP, and IPBD is the IWORK segment IWP.
